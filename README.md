# Tracker Physics for Sonic Frontiers

The 'Tracker Tweaks' name comes to yet another game... and this time, it's Sonic Frontiers' turn.

I like Frontiers! But the controls do bug a little sometimes - the fact Sonic's 06-levels of slow without boosting, the massive airbrake, the drop dash feeling a little unwieldly and uncurling constantly... and of course, the cyberspace levels are just bad. I tinkered with a few physics mods already uploaded here, and while they're really nicely made I couldn't land on one that totally clicked with me. That, and you usually have to disable them for the Squid chase on Chaos Island.

So here's my own physics mod! It's generally closer to how Frontiers generally feels and is more made with its game design in mind, so you shouldn't expect a radical overhaul - it's just my attempt to sand off some of the edges and make the control flow a little better.



### Changes include:

- Sonic's ground speed limit is increased, so you can go a bit faster without boosting, and he'll pick up more speed going down slopes.

- The airboost has been slightly buffed too.

- The drop dash has been overhauled - you now only uncurl when near a dead-stop, SA1/SA2 style, and turning is far easier. This allows you to really mess around with it on hilly terrain, which now affects it more realistically.

- The homing attack has been massively sped up.

- The parry now has a smaller window. It's still fairly lenient, but you do have to put some effort into timing it now.

- Sonic's jumping airbrake has been considerably reduced, especially when boosting. I'm still working on getting this to work with the drop dash too.

- Cyberspace (both 3D and 2D) has been considerably reworked - in general you're faster, and in 2D Sonic's roll works slightly better... so long as you leave the analog stick alone. It's still pretty jank though, I can only do so much.


I hope you get a kick out of this, at any rate! There's a few changes I'd maybe still like to make (and perhaps have a nosey at combat) but I'm happy enough to release it for now. The version number starts at 1.03, as I released a few earlier versions outside of GameBanana for testing purposes.
