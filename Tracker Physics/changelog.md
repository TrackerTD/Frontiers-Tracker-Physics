## Tracker Physics 1.8.3
- Increased Knuckles' climbing speed slightly to be closer to vanilla. This should strike a nice balance of control, while still having access to the Boost for scaling.
- Finally nerfed Sonic's airboost, which I've been meaning to do for ages. It's still better than vanilla, but I felt it was a tad broken before. 

## Tracker Physics 1.8.2
- Reduced Knuckles' climbing speed considerably, and slightly weakened Sonic's. 

## Tracker Physics 1.8.1
- Made adjustments to Amy, Knuckles and Tails - namely more slope influence on speed, and gliding/flying startup time reductions.

## Tracker Physics 1.8
- Added preliminary support for Update 3 of Sonic Frontiers. 
- Many nerfs from Hyper Fighting have been undone to make Final Horizon actually possible. I will continue to rebalance this. 
- This update may not install correctly via HMM. If Sonic's behaving strangely after updating, reinstall the mod from GameBanana.

## Tracker Physics 1.7
- Added preliminary support for Update 2 of Sonic Frontiers.
- This update may not install correctly via HMM. If Sonic's behaving strangely after updating, reinstall the mod from GameBanana.

## Tracker Physics 1.6
- Update Server added
- Tracker Physics and Hyper Fighting combined into one mod, you can use Configure Mod to choose whether to enable the combat changes or not.
- Parry Timing adjusted to 1.5
